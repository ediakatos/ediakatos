## Hey there! I'm Evangelos (a.k.a. @ediakatos) <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

I'm a **curious maker** who loves blending the worlds of technology, problem-solving, and a dash of creativity.  
*(And yes, coffee is basically my sidekick on this journey.)*

### 👀 Interests
- **Tech Experimentation**: Always exploring new frameworks, languages, and tools.  
- **Creative Coding**: Geospatial Pipelines, Automated Bash & Cybersecurity Scripts, and Web Apps    
- **Coffee Culture**: Pour-over, espresso, cold brew... you name it, I probably have strong opinions about it.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Because shipping code that actually runs in production is the real magic trick.  
- **Data & Security Fusion**: Building data pipelines that are secure enough to keep hackers away (no espresso for them!).  
- **Map Nerd Stuff**: Exploring geospatial data—like treasure maps, but for humanitarian good (and maybe a bit of fun).

### A Dash More About Me
- **Problem Solver**: If it’s broken, I’m probably tinkering with it. If it’s not broken, I might still tinker—sorry!  
- **Coffee Connoisseur**: Brewing, sipping, repeating (the perfect workflow?).  
- **Creative Explorer**: Never too afraid to try something new—whether it’s a framework or a fresh roast.

### Random Tidbits
- I once tried to automate a **power-efficient environmental monitoring system** using Raspberry Pi, Pi Pico, and AWS—like a Swiss Army knife for data.   
- My debugging fuel: Python, BASH, and a double-shot espresso.  
- Favorite phrase: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” Applies to data pipelines *and* pour-over technique.
